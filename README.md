The problem identified by the group for clincs is that private clinics maintain individual clinic pages, but there they lack centralization.

The purpose of this page to to establish a unified platform where all private clinics or GPs can be easily located and where payment can be facilitated within the website itself.

In this webpage, we have key features that will direct the user to make a booking at the clinic nearest to them. The new booking will be added into the calender for their ease. Upon completion of the consultation, users can make payment directly through the webpage.

4. Javascript
